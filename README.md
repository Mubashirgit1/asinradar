### Solved Bugs

üêõ Bug Fixes
As part of the development of ASIN RADAR, the following bugs were identified and successfully resolved:

‚úÖ Carousel Not Sliding or Responsive
Resolved by including Bootstrap JavaScript dependencies (jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap.js) in the correct order and replacing fixed image dimensions with responsive classes (img-fluid, w-100).

‚úÖ Slider Text Misaligned on Mobile
Applied media queries and adjusted the .text-box layout to ensure headings and animations remain properly positioned across all screen sizes.

‚úÖ WOW.js Animations Not Working
Fixed by correctly initializing WOW.js and confirming animate.css was loaded. Ensured animation elements were visible on load.

‚úÖ Footer Misaligned on Small Screens
Reworked footer layout using Flexbox and mobile-first CSS. Now stacks content vertically (logo, links, contact, and social icons) for better readability on mobile devices.

‚úÖ Navbar Overlapping Slider Content
Added spacing and z-index fixes to prevent the navigation bar from covering slider content on scroll or load.

‚úÖ Contact Section Broken on Mobile
Adjusted column stacking and spacing to ensure contact boxes and support content display cleanly on small screens.                                                                                   |

## Credits

### Main 
The development of ASIN RADAR was made possible with the support, tools, and inspiration provided by the following individuals and platforms:

ChatGPT (by OpenAI)

Generating concepts and ideas for the homepage slider images

Refining responsive layout strategies using Bootstrap

Drafting README content and documentation

üîó Keepa API
Keepa provided essential backend support through its powerful Amazon product data API. I integrated Keepa to:

Fetch real-time Amazon pricing and sales data

Analyze ASIN-based trends

Support performance tracking features in the app
Their extensive documentation and reliable API endpoints were crucial for making ASIN RADAR a data-driven tool.

 SellerAmp (Inspiration)
SellerAmp is a well-known Amazon seller analytics tool that served as a key source of inspiration.
By studying its feature set and interface design, I was able to:

Understand user expectations in the Amazon selling ecosystem

Define the core features of ASIN RADAR (like real-time data, simplified UI, and mobile-friendly tools)

Benchmark usability and performance goals

While ASIN RADAR is an independent project, SellerAmp helped shape my vision of what an effective Amazon selling assistant should look like.

 Graeme Taylor (Tutor & Mentor)
Huge thanks to Graeme Taylor, my tutor and mentor throughout this journey.
His feedback, technical guidance, and encouragement helped me:

Structure the project efficiently

Stay on track through challenges

Learn to balance UI/UX design with functionality
Graeme‚Äôs input was instrumental in building both the frontend and backend components of ASIN RADAR.
